#FizzBuzz Worklog

Initially began by programming integers 1-100 to show using a template literal

Used if statements to specify when the computer should replace an integer with fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz

Computer printed fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz along with the integer instead of replacing it

Replaced some if statements with else if, nothing changed

Copied and pasted the else if example from the code-along into eloquent javascript, moving the template literal to the bottom line and giving each statement its own set of brackets

Computer correctly replaced the specified integers with fizz, buzz, and fizzbuzz
