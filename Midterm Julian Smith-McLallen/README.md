#Midterm Project Worklog
Began by creating Spanish tile design on canva, screenshotted for reference
![Spanish Tile](../../../Spanish%20tile.png)
This design included a red eight-point star, a blue four-point star, and a yellow flower with six petals

The goal was to create a customizable array of tiles

Created initial squares for tile design, using noStroke() to remove the outlines

Used the rotate() command to make eight-point stars out of two squares

Command rotated the coordinate system 45 degrees, positioning became extremely difficult

Switched to the beginShape() command to create custom shapes and position them

Began creating arcs for flower petals

Design is still incomplete
