#Midterm Project Worklog
Began by creating Spanish tile design on canva, screenshotted for reference

Created initial squares for tile design

Used the rotate() command to make eight-point stars

Command rotated the coordinate system 45 degrees, positioning became extremely difficult

Switched to the beginShape() command to create custom shapes and position them

Began creating arcs for flower petals

Design is still incomplete
