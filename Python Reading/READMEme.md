#Ch. 1

I knew of the different types of values and how to correctly represent them in code, however I learned about the concept of formal and natural languages, with formal being used algorithmically, and with clear logic to explain concepts in literal terms, whereas natural languages have context-dependent, and metaphorical terms, making them interpretative.

#Ch. 3

Going into this chapter, I knew about the concept of a function, and how it can manipulate values, changing how they're represented and concatenated. I had no idea however that making a function was so open-ended, and that they could be efficient stand-ins for repetitive statements and commands.

#Ch.5

This chapter started by explaining the concept of an elif clause, which I was familiar with. It then went into detail on how to make functions call and reference themselves. I was only partially familiar with this concept, but Downey explains that this is a powerful tool that helps automate various processes. He also shows that it can be accomplished with only a few lines of code.

#Ch. 10

The content of chapter 10 and the concept of dictionaries within a program I was completely unfamiliar with. It introduced the 'dict' class of objects, as well as new operators such as the 'in' operator. One thing I had least recognized were the looping functions and how they were used in accumulating a list.
